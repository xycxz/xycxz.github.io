As an Electronic Engineering student and hands-on cybersecurity practitioner, I'm passionate about deconstructing complex systems to understand how they work, how they break, and how to make them secure. This curiosity isn't just theoretical; I apply it by building, analyzing, and securing cloud-native application stacks from the ground up.

My core focus areas are:

- Cloud & Application Security: I build and deploy multi-tier applications on AWS using Docker, architecting custom security controls with IAM and Security Groups. I then analyze these systems for common and complex vulnerabilities, related to web and Active Directory.

- Automation & Infrastructure as Code (IaC): I have a deep interest in system internals, from analyzing network protocols with Wireshark to automating complex deployments with Docker Compose (for example). My goal is to build resilient, reproducible, and secure infrastructure.

- Offensive Security Research: I continuously sharpen my practical skills by intentionally misconfiguring services to replicate and understand real-world attack chains and threat actor methodologies.

I'm always looking for new challenges that merge my university background with my cybersecurity skills. I'm currently seeking opportunities in Cloud Security, System Administrator, and DevSecOps where I can contribute to building and defending robust systems.
