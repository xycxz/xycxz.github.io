I'm an Electronic Engineering student with a strong interest in offensive security, vulnerability research, and understanding how systems work at their core. I enjoy exploring the intersection between hardware and cybersecurity—digging deep into how things operate, break, and can be made secure again.

My passion lies in:

Security research — uncovering vulnerabilities in systems and learning from the process.

Reverse engineering — understanding how software and hardware behave under the hood.

Whether it's studying signal behavior in circuits or testing the limits of a software system, I'm driven by curiosity and the desire to build (and break) things to learn how they really work.
